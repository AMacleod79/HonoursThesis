Most computer based algorithms in medicine = experts systems ie rules for knowledge on a topic applied to draw conclusion on a clinical scenario. Machine learning is different: starts with patient level observations looking for combinations that reliably predict outcomes (similar to traditional regression models = outcome, covariates, statistical function to link the two). Butu machine learning can handle large amount of predictors + combine in non linear and intercative ways (here check paper by Mullainathan). We can now use new kinds of data which could not previously be used.
Eg radiographs, insurance claims
Problems if letting data speak for itself: overfitting of preditcions can lead to spurious correlations; multicoliinear predictors could produce unstable estimates (ref???) => overly optimistic estimates of accuracy and exageratted claims about real world performance.
Other issue is quality and quantity of input data. ML requires millions of observation to reach accpetable performance levels. Beware of biais in the data collection. Existing data in EHR/claims database need curation and processing before use.
Machine learning does not solve any of the fundamental problems of causal inference in observational data sets: preditcing outcomes but predictors are not causes. Correclation is not causation.
Three key areas where likely to have an impact:
- prognosis through data mining of existing EHR
- radiologists/pathologists: analysis of imaging done through algorithm (mammograms)
- diagnostic accuracy}

What is machine learning? Most algorithms in medicine are experts systems i.e rules encoding knowledge of a topic applied to draw conclusions about specific clinical scenarios (eg. detecting drug interactions or judging the appropriateness of obtaining radiologic imaging) But machine learning is learning rules from the data. Patient-level observations are analysed and algorithms look for combinations that reliably predict outcomes. Similar to traditional regression models: outcome, covariates and statistcial function linking the two. But ML can handle large amount numbers of predictors and combine them in nonlinear and interactive ways}
